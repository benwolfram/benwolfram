### Hey, I'm Ben 👋

I am a front-end web engineer living in Winnipeg, Canada.

Currently, I'm working on the [SkipTheDishes](https://skipthedishes.com) customer-facing web app feeding millions of hungry Canadians. I get a kick out of the UI/UX and design system side of my job and just want to spend all my time making pretty things 💅🏻🦋.

My favorite GitHub repo is [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core)!
