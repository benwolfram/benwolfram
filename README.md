### Hey, I'm Ben 👋

I am a front-end web engineer living in Winnipeg, Canada.

Currently, I'm working on [Themes](https://themes.shopify.com) at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) making commerce better for everyone. Previously, the [SkipTheDishes](https://skipthedishes.com) customer-facing web app feeding millions of hungry Canadians. I get a kick out of the UI/UX and design system side of my job and just want to spend all my time making pretty things 💅🏻🦋.

My favorite GitHub repo is [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core)!
